// CG: This file was added by the AppWizard Tools component

The following files were generated by this component:

WizUtil.cpp, WizUtil.h
	Useful macro-setting help functions.

ClassDlg.cpp, ClassDlg.h
Names.cpp, Names.h
	The classes browser dialog class and information storage class


What to do next:

1) DOCUMENTATION
If you haven't yet read the documentation on this component, you might
want to give it a look.  From the Insert menu, choose Component.  Then,
select this component and click the "?" button.

2) HOOK UP CLASSES BROWSER STEP
Take a look at the TODO comment inserted at the end of your
CDialogChooser's constructor.  It has some tips on how to get the step
up and running.
	Also, take a look at CClassesDlg::OnShowWindow to see an
example of how to populate the classes browser.  You'll want to replace
that sample code with your own code to add classes.
	Please note that you should not use this step in a custom AppWizard
based on standard AppWizard steps.  You should use the standard AppWizard
dialog (step 6 of 6 when creating an MDI or SDI application, for example).
to handle this functionality instead.
